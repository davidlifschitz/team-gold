Students will build a tool for stock analysis and selection using publicly available data sets such as 13F filings, Yahoo Finance, and SEC filings. The project will require students to gather, clean, and combine data from the multiple data sources.  The consolidated data will then be analyzed to provide the end user with insight to support stock selection decision-making. The tool should be designed so that data and analysis can be easily updated by the end user as data refreshes become available.
